Sure, you can hack a lot of those things in there, but I really wanted to ditch it altogether and JUST USE WHAT I NEED.</p><p>I know this site is a few years old, but still very relevant. It doesn't seem too hard to transition this to work with OpenGL 4.5. <br>Thank you so much for these tutorials!</p></span></p></a></a></li><li class="discovery-post post-3" id="discovery-link-organic-3672801954"><a class="publisher-anchor-color" href="http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnopengl.com%2F%23%21Advanced-Lighting%2FShadows%2FPoint-Shadows&amp;key=wBw8CfZE_6-zJaRi2mDXRw" target="" rel=""><header class="discovery-post-header"><h3 title="Point Shadows"><span data-role="discovery-thread-title" class="title line-truncate" data-line-truncate="2">Point Shadows</span></h3><ul class="meta"><li class="comments">96 comments </li> <li class="time">4 years ago</li></ul></header><a class="top-comment" data-role="discovery-top-comment" href="http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnopengl.com%2F%23%21Advanced-Lighting%2FShadows%2FPoint-Shadows&amp;key=wBw8CfZE_6-zJaRi2mDXRw" target="" rel=""><img alt="Avatar" data-role="discovery-avatar"><p class="discovery-top-comment-wrapper"><span class="user" data-role="discovery-top-comment-author">Fezzboygaming 10</span> — <span data-role="discovery-top-comment-snippet" class="line-truncate" data-line-truncate="3"><p>This is great and all, but does anyone have any idea how implement shadows with multiple lights? i'm guessing the scene is rendered to a depth map for each light and then all depth maps are passed to the shader which determines whether the fragment is occluded by any of the depth values, if so the fragment is in shadow? This seems fairly memory and performance heavy so I'm hoping someone has a different solution</p></span></p></a></a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><div id="footer" data-tracking-area="footer" class="disqus-footer__wrapper"><ul class="disqus-footer"><li class="disqus-footer__logo"><a href="https://disqus.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Powered by Disqus" class="disqus-footer__link">Powered by Disqus</a></li><li id="thread-subscribe-button" class="email disqus-footer__item"><div class="default"><a href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;f=learnopengl&amp;t_i=PBR%2FIBL%2FDiffuse-irradiance&amp;t_u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnopengl.com%2FPBR%2FIBL%2FDiffuse-irradiance&amp;t_d=LearnOpenGL%20-%20Diffuse%20irradiance&amp;t_t=LearnOpenGL%20-%20Diffuse%20irradiance&amp;s_o=default#" rel="nofollow" data-action="subscribe" title="Subscribe and get email updates from this discussion" class="disqus-footer__link"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-mail"></i><span class="clip">Subscribe</span><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-checkmark"></i></a></div></li><li class="install disqus-footer__item"><a href="https://publishers.disqus.com/engage?utm_source=learnopengl&amp;utm_medium=Disqus-Footer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="disqus-footer__link"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-disqus"></i><span class="clip hidden-md">Add Disqus to your site</span><span class="clip visible-md hidden-xs">Add Disqus</span><span class="clip visible-xs">Add</span></a></li><li class="privacy disqus-footer__item"><a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="disqus-footer__link"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-lock"></i><span class="clip hidden-sm">Disqus' Privacy Policy</span><span class="clip visible-sm hidden-xs">Privacy Policy</span><span class="clip visible-xs">Privacy</span></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
